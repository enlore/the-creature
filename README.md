# The Creature

_PHUUHIN ONNA RRRIIITZ_

## What is this?

A guide and a list of tools to aimed at helping you make your own Franken-Site.

## What do I do with it?

1. Get [Skeleton]() from the Skeleton Framework page.
2. Run through the list of [Bones]() and pick out the things you'll need.
3. Put 'em together and make your own monseter.

## So this is a field guide for cobbling together various parts to make a cohesive site?

You got it.

## Why?

The web is a gnarly, mixed up place to build things. The execution and
rendering environments for our code are wildly inconsistent, given to
a constantly shifting, heaving landscape. Data comes and goes like a breeze.
The communities are volatile, ever changing.  The tools, likewise.

As developers, we seek to make our lives easier by doing a bunch of redundant work
up front so we can focus on the important stuff.

Doing that for the web is hard (see above). A handful of really successful projects
have done it well, and have become huge in the process.

Mobile is more important every second, driven by the proliferation of more
affordable, more powerful devices. Driven by increasing the sheer accessibility
of the web. More people on the web is better for people and the web.

So we shift our focus. Huge can be a problem if you're targetting users on
weak networks. Huge can result in slow, and huge can result in difficulty
extending and maintaining.

Rather than one huge package, many small packages. Rather than everything included,
only what's needed. This gets tricky too, though. Keeping things isolated and modular,
reducting redundancy. The browser makes this hard.

Big framework or no, we end up creating frankensites, mashing together various
libraries and components in pursuit of getting things done.

We end up making The Creature.

Here, as an experiment, we'll collect a simple guide, some straightforward
tools, and a list of small, quality components. This guide will server any who
use it, but it'll be aimed at less experienced developers. It will seek to
illustrate common practise and help people avoid pitfalls. It will provide a
handy field guide to sourcing UI components and rolling them into your projects.
